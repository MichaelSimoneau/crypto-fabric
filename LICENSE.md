# Crypto Fabric GCP Private License (Root Repository)

**Version 1.0 — Effective on execution by Holder**

## 1. Ownership
Enigma Key Industries, LLC ("Licensor") exclusively owns all source code,
documentation, configurations, and artifacts contained in the root of the
crypto-fabric-gcp repository (the "Root Assets"). All rights not expressly
granted are reserved.

## 2. Limited Viewing Grant
Subject to continuous compliance with this license, Licensor grants the
recipient ("Licensee") a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable
permission to **view** the Root Assets solely for internal security review and
due-diligence evaluation. No build, execution, distribution, adaptation, or
derivative use is authorized without a separately executed commercial
agreement with Licensor that covers each intended use case and associated
fees.

## 3. Prohibited Uses
Licensee shall not, without prior written authorization from Licensor:
- copy, distribute, host, or otherwise make the Root Assets available to any
  third party;
- run, compile, deploy, benchmark, or integrate the Root Assets in any
  environment, production or otherwise;
- modify, translate, or create derivative works from the Root Assets;
- reverse engineer any binaries derived from the Root Assets; or
- remove proprietary notices or metadata from the Root Assets.

Any attempt to exercise rights beyond the viewing grant voids this license and
constitutes infringement subject to statutory damages, injunctive relief, and
recovery of attorneys' fees.

## 4. Payment & Commercial Access
Production, staging, testing, or proof-of-concept usage of the Root Assets
requires an executed written agreement with Licensor and payment of all fees,
including any success-based profit shares stipulated by Licensor. Unauthorized
use triggers immediate suspension, back-billing at Licensor's prevailing rates
(plus 35% penalty), and demand for disgorgement of any gains realized.

## 5. Confidentiality
The Root Assets are confidential trade secrets. Licensee shall protect them
with safeguards no less rigorous than those applied to Licensee's own
confidential materials, and in no event less than commercially reasonable
standards. Disclosure is permitted only to employees or advisors bound by
written obligations at least as protective as this license and solely for the
purpose described in Section 2.

## 6. Audit & Verification
Licensor may require written certification of compliance and, on reasonable
notice, may audit systems used to access the Root Assets. Licensee shall fully
cooperate and bear the costs of any audit revealing a breach.

## 7. Termination
Licensor may terminate this license immediately upon written notice for any
breach. Upon termination, Licensee must permanently delete all copies of the
Root Assets and certify destruction within five (5) business days.

## 8. Governing Law & Venue
This license is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without
regard to conflicts principles. Exclusive jurisdiction resides in the state or
federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, and Licensee consents to
personal jurisdiction therein.

## 9. Remedies
Licensee acknowledges that unauthorized use causes irreparable harm and agrees
that Licensor is entitled to equitable relief in addition to any other
available remedies. Licensee shall indemnify Licensor against all claims,
damages, and costs (including attorneys' fees) arising from Licensee's breach.

## 10. Entire Agreement
This document constitutes the entire agreement regarding viewing rights to the
Root Assets and supersedes all prior discussions. No waiver or modification is
valid unless in a writing signed by Licensor.
